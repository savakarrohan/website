      <description>Trekking equipment It&amp;rsquo;s a cold monsoon afternoon, you are up in the mountains, and you have carried your backpack and equipment for well over 6 hours and you are planning to set camp at this flat spot you found beside the stream. You slowly unpack the bag and notice your equipment, you check if they are suitable for this location, and you ponder over how did you manage to carry so much that morning.</description>

      <description>The world of sports is amazing, everyone is on a level playing field following the same set of rules and a participant or team attempts to do their best. In my personal opinion it&amp;rsquo;s the perfect substitution to war. Much like how countries spend billions in their respective armed forces and technologies, sportspeople too spend their time finding that advantage over their opponent. I believe this is the primary reason why technology develops first in the armed forces and then quickly follows in to the world of sports.</description>

      <description>Optimization is a problem important in everyones lives, we all have fixed amount of resources and intend to do the best we can with this available resource. These resources could be in the form of money, valuable resources like wood, material for projects and most importantly time (A very important asset I have only just realised). These resources are limited and we wish to use them appropiately to gain the most &amp;ldquo;utility&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Introduction The Rubik&amp;rsquo;s cube is a 3D - combination puzzle invented in 1974 by a Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture Ern≈ë Rubik. It was initially called the magic cube but as the toy slowly became an international sensation the business men marketed it as the Rubik&amp;rsquo;s cube, a much more catchy name. The cube comprises of 6 faces of different color where a solved state of the cube occurs when all the faces of the cube has a single color.</description>

      <description>The recent naming ceremony of Facebook caught my eye, I noticed the symbolic play going on about the company but I seemed to be more intrigued by the new symbol of META. It looked different, peacefull, everending and capable of much much more. This reminded me of the paintings being made by the garage artists, hanging a paint bucket and pushing it on to a blank canvas. I was perplexed when I finally found an article for parametric curves and dwelled in to the beatifull mathematics behind art.</description>

      <description>Lets take a moment to revise everything so far;
 We learnt that we tend to reward good behaviour while reprimanding unfavourable ones. We learnt that states represent the factors which influence a person&amp;rsquo;s decision. We learnt that the most recent state effects the players future decisions more than previous states  The actual computer Now to the dirty business, how shall we make this computer? We saw that the states are independent of each other and primarily a decision is based purely out of the most recent state, so it makes sense to have containers of all the possible states.</description>

      <description>The Matchbox Educable Noughts and Crosses Engine (MENACE)is a mechanical computer made from 304 matchboxes designed and built by Donald Mitchie in 1961.
What? During world war II when computers were essentially mechanical devices and women crunching numbers, there was an interest to make a computer to learn by itself. Eager to demonstrate artificial intelligence through &amp;ldquo;trial and error learning&amp;rdquo; in simple mental games he constructed a device out of matchboxes to test out his algorithms.</description>
