Trekking and camping equipment are essential for any adventure in the mountains. The unpredictable weather, and harsh conditions make it difficult to find food, shelter and water. The weather forces us to be prepared for snow, rain and even the sun. In this environment it is important to have safe, reliable and light equipment to carry around.

Having trekked overnight for the first time in the Himalayas last week, I noticed small and simple innovations which make this sport safer. From the numerous straps in a backpack, to the ease of packing an entire tent and even the materials chosen for the shoes, metal components and types of stoves used.

What mostly caught my eye was the tent stakes. It was baffling to me that 10 such spokes could easily hold down a tent in conditions of windy gusts. These components allow us to feel safe despite the weather. Now there are various types of these stakes available in the market, they are essentially poles stuck in to the ground. We use similar devices in other situations such as anchor bolts to hold down street light poles on the sides of roads. These bolts should hold down the various loads that such a structure can experience such as lift and shear loads from gusty winds.

The various methods in which this component can fail, is material failure (Tensile, Shear) or the surface it is embedded in might "breakout", "split", or "blowout". The calculations for material failure is rather straight forward, but higher factors of safety should be considered for the surface because of irregularities in the surface.

_Note: One can introduce factors such as "Pattern: How close the next stake is", "Edge Distance: to compensate for how close the edge is to the stake", "Material homogenity: To consider homogenous materials" amongst other factors for a more accurate modelling of the system but a time saving technique would be to consider a higher factor of safety._
