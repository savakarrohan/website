The recent naming ceremony of Facebook caught my eye, I noticed the symbolic play going on about the company but I seemed to be more intrigued by the new symbol of META. It looked different, peacefull, everending and capable of much much more. This reminded me of the paintings being made by the garage artists, hanging a paint bucket and pushing it on to a blank canvas. I was perplexed when I finally found an article for parametric curves and dwelled in to the beatifull mathematics behind art.
