The recent naming ceremony of Facebook caught my eye, I noticed the symbolic play going on about the company but I seemed to be more intrigued by the new symbol of META. It looked different, peacefull, everending and capable of much much more. This reminded me of the paintings being made by the garage artists, hanging a paint bucket and pushing it on to a blank canvas. I was perplexed when I finally found an article for parametric curves and dwelled in to the beatifull mathematics behind art.

## Introduction

Curves are seen in a lot of applications from art, to engineering, to science. These curves also appear to be solutions to many solutions in the engineering field. It is well known that an arch which is a parabola which is a member of the family of conic sections. There are various ways to draw curves, we could draw using a parametric equation, a function could be written. At the same time we could use define the curve under different coordinate systems. It might be easier to draw a different curve on different systems.

A lissaguous curve can be constructed with a parametric curve (t) and 4 variables ( a,b,c,d ) $$a^2$$
